# Formalizing Quantifiers

A formalization of quantifiers based on:

* formulas as first-order structures
* binding for quantifier rules implemented with de Bruijn indices

It applies to:

* first-order logics
* second-order propositional logics (a la system F for example)

Content:

* `fot.v`: definitions and properties of first-order terms
* `nj1.v`: formulas and natural deduction for _first-order_ Intuitionistic Logic (normalization proof)
* `nj2.v`: formulas and natural deduction for _second-order_ Intuitionistic Logic
